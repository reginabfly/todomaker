# ToDo Maker

This To Do App was built utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## About The Game

This exercise was a way for practicing utilizing JavaScript to create a simple application. On the first input, you can enter your todo and click the "add" button. You can add more things you have to do or you can click the "delete" button next to the item to get rid of it. For the next input, you have to enter an array index and then the item you want to change. For instance, if you want to change the first todo item you would do "0" in the first input and the second input would be the todo you want to change it to. The first spot is 0 and the second is 1 and so on. For the final button, you also put the array location you want to toggle checked or unchecked. You also have the option to click the top button "toggle all" to check them all off or unmark them as well.
